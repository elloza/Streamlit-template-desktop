**Commit message template**:
```
fix: Replace subprocess with multiprocessing to prevent infinite process spawning on Windows

BREAKING: Architecture change from subprocess.Popen to multiprocessing.Process

Root Cause:
- subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, ...]) in PyInstaller spawned .exe again
- sys.executable points to frozen .exe, not python.exe
- Created infinite fork bomb requiring system restart

Solution:
- Use multiprocessing.Process with worker function
- PyInstaller's pyi_rth_multiprocessing.py hook handles frozen execution
- Worker process executes Streamlit without spawning main()

Benefits:
- Process isolation (Streamlit crashes don't affect main app)
- PyInstaller native support (no custom build logic)
- Compatible with subprocess tools (Playwright, Selenium)
- Same bundle size (~150MB)

Testing:
- ‚úÖ Direct Python: 4 processes (main + worker + overhead)
- ‚úÖ PyInstaller build: 2 processes (main + worker)
- ‚úÖ Stability: Monitored 15s, no spawning
- ‚úÖ Clean shutdown verified

Files changed:
- app.py: Migrated to multiprocessing architecture
- specs/main/research.md: Documented research and decision
- specs/main/HOTFIX-MULTIPROCESSING.md: Complete hotfix documentation
- CHANGELOG.md: Added v0.1.1 release notes

### Create Git Tag

- [ ] T024 Create annotated git tag v0.1.1
- [ ] T025 Push commits to origin main
- [ ] T026 Push tag v0.1.1 to origin

**Tag creation**:
```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Fix Windows infinite process spawning bug"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.1
```

## Phase 5: GitHub Release

### Create GitHub Release

- [ ] T027 Navigate to GitHub repository releases page
- [ ] T028 Click "Draft a new release"
- [ ] T029 Select tag v0.1.1
- [ ] T030 Set release title: "v0.1.1 - Hotfix: Windows Process Spawn Bug"
- [ ] T031 Add release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] T032 Attach Windows build artifact (StreamlitApp-v0.1.1-windows.zip)
- [ ] T033 Mark as "This is a pre-release" if template is still in beta
- [ ] T034 Publish release

# v0.1.1 - Critical Hotfix: Windows Process Spawn Bug

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUG FIX

This hotfix resolves a critical bug where the Windows desktop application spawned infinite processes, requiring system restart.

## What's Fixed

- **Windows Infinite Process Spawning**: The application no longer spawns infinite processes on Windows when built with PyInstaller
- **Architecture Migration**: Migrated from `subprocess.Popen` to `multiprocessing.Process` for better PyInstaller compatibility
- **Process Isolation**: Streamlit now runs in a separate process with full isolation from the main application

## Root Cause

When using `subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, ...])` in a PyInstaller frozen executable:
- `sys.executable` pointed to `StreamlitApp.exe` instead of `python.exe`
- Each subprocess call spawned the entire application again
- This created an infinite fork bomb that crashed the system

## Solution

Replaced subprocess architecture with `multiprocessing.Process`, which:
- Uses PyInstaller's native multiprocessing runtime hooks
- Spawns worker processes using the embedded Python interpreter
- Provides full process isolation without self-replication

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Process Isolation**: Streamlit crashes won't affect the main application
‚úÖ **PyInstaller Compatible**: Uses native runtime hooks (`pyi_rth_multiprocessing.py`)
‚úÖ **No Size Penalty**: Uses embedded interpreter (no need to bundle python.exe)
‚úÖ **Playwright Compatible**: External subprocess tools still work normally
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Testing

- ‚úÖ Direct Python execution: 4 processes (main + worker + overhead)
- ‚úÖ PyInstaller Windows build: 2 processes (main + worker)
- ‚úÖ Stability: Verified no spawning after 15 seconds
- ‚úÖ Clean shutdown: Processes terminate correctly

## Installation

### Windows
1. Download `StreamlitApp-v0.1.1-windows.zip`
2. Extract to a folder
3. Run `StreamlitApp.exe`

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Streamlit-template-desktop.git
cd Streamlit-template-desktop
git checkout v0.1.1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Upgrade Notes

If upgrading from v0.1.0:
- No configuration changes required
- No breaking changes to user-facing features
- Internal architecture change only (subprocess ‚Üí multiprocessing)

## Technical Details

For complete technical documentation, see:
- [HOTFIX-MULTIPROCESSING.md](specs/main/HOTFIX-MULTIPROCESSING.md)
- [research.md](specs/main/research.md)

## Files Changed

- `app.py`: Complete rewrite of Streamlit server management
- `specs/main/research.md`: Research findings and architecture decision
- `specs/main/HOTFIX-MULTIPROCESSING.md`: Detailed hotfix documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Release notes

## Phase 6: Post-Release Verification

### Verify Release

- [ ] T035 Download release artifact from GitHub
- [ ] T036 Extract and test on clean Windows machine (if available)
- [ ] T037 Verify executable launches without infinite spawning
- [ ] T038 Check release appears correctly on GitHub releases page

### Communication

- [ ] T039 [P] Update project documentation to reference v0.1.1
- [ ] T040 [P] Notify users via GitHub Discussions or relevant channels
- [ ] T041 [P] Close any related issues on GitHub

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
- T022-T023 must complete before T024-T026 (commit before tag)
- T024-T026 must complete before T027-T034 (tag before release)
- T015-T019 must complete before T032 (build before attaching)

### Parallel Opportunities
- T010-T011 can run in parallel (different documentation files)
- T020-T021 can run in parallel with Windows build if applicable
- T039-T041 can run in parallel (different communication channels)

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Version bumped to 0.1.1 in all files
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md updated with hotfix notes
- ‚úÖ Git commit created with proper message
- ‚úÖ Git tag v0.1.1 created and pushed
- ‚úÖ GitHub release published with artifacts
- ‚úÖ Windows build tested and verified stable
- ‚úÖ No infinite process spawning confirmed

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after release:
1. Create new hotfix branch
2. Revert problematic changes
3. Create v0.1.2 with revert
4. Follow same release process

## Notes

- This is a critical hotfix addressing a system-crashing bug
- Testing has been thorough (direct Python + PyInstaller build)
- Architecture change is internal, no user-facing breaking changes
- Documentation is comprehensive for future maintenance
- Build size remains unchanged (~150MB)
