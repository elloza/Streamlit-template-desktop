# Tasks: Fix Release Binary - Streamlit Worker Process Crash

**Feature**: Resolve PyInstaller executable failure (exit code 2) on Windows
**Input**: Error logs from v0.1.6 release showing worker process crash
**Root Cause**: Relative path resolution and missing bundled configuration in PyInstaller build

## Context: Release Failure Analysis

The v0.1.6 release executable crashes immediately with exit code 2:

```
[2025-10-18 22:40:02] [ERROR] [root] Streamlit process terminated unexpectedly
[2025-10-18 22:40:02] [ERROR] [root] Process exit code: 2
```

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. CRITICAL: Relative path `src/ui/main_app.py` in worker process cannot be resolved
2. CRITICAL: Missing `.streamlit/config.toml` in PyInstaller bundle
3. HIGH: Missing hidden imports for Streamlit runtime modules
4. HIGH: Working directory mismatch between main and worker processes
5. MEDIUM: Insufficient error capturing from worker process

**Success Criteria:**
- PyInstaller executable launches without crashes
- Streamlit worker process starts successfully within 15 seconds
- Desktop window opens and displays Streamlit UI
- Application works when launched from any directory location

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Diagnostic Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Add diagnostic tools to capture root cause of future failures

- [X] T009 Add missing Streamlit runtime hidden imports to StreamlitApp.spec line 14

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - Streamlit worker can now find and load main_app.py ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Fix Worker Process Startup (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Streamlit worker process starts successfully and server becomes ready on port 8501

**Independent Test**: Run `dist/StreamlitApp/StreamlitApp.exe` from any directory and verify no crash within 15 seconds

### Implementation for User Story 1

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Worker Startup): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (Config Loading): Can start after Foundational - Parallel with US1
  - US3 (Hidden Imports): Can start after Foundational - Parallel with US1/US2
  - US4 (Error Reporting): Depends on US1 completion - Needs working subprocess
  - US5 (Path Compatibility): Depends on US1 completion - Needs working paths
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - CRITICAL for release
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on US1 (needs working worker process to test error capture)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on US1 (needs working paths to test compatibility)

### Within Each User Story

- Diagnostics before implementation
- Path fixes before configuration fixes
- Configuration before imports
- Working process before error reporting
- All core fixes before testing

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T005-T009 after T004)
- US1, US2, US3 can all be implemented in parallel by different developers
- All hidden import additions (T022-T029) can run in parallel
- Path resolution tasks (T038-T039) can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks (T044-T045, T049-T050) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Hidden Imports)

```bash
# Launch all hidden import additions together:
Task: "Add streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner to hidden imports"
Task: "Add streamlit.runtime.app_session to hidden imports"
Task: "Add streamlit.elements.widgets to hidden imports"
Task: "Add streamlit.proto to hidden imports"
Task: "Add streamlit.logger to hidden imports"
Task: "Add pydantic to hidden imports"
Task: "Add typing_extensions to hidden imports"
Task: "Add importlib.metadata to hidden imports"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (diagnostic infrastructure)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (fix worker startup)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (fix config loading)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (fix hidden imports)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Build and test executable
7. If working, proceed to Phase 8 (release)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Can diagnose failures
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Worker starts (may have import errors)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Configuration loads correctly
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí All modules import successfully
5. Test executable ‚Üí **First working release!**
6. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Better error messages for future issues
7. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Works from any directory
8. Each story adds robustness without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (worker startup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (config loading)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (hidden imports)
3. Integrate all three stories
4. Test combined build
5. Developer A: User Story 4 (error reporting)
6. Developer B: User Story 5 (path compatibility)

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify

| File | Changes | Phase |
|------|---------|-------|
| app.py | Absolute paths, error capture, bundle detection | P2, P3, P6 |
| StreamlitApp.spec | Add .streamlit, hidden imports | P2, P5 |
| .streamlit/config.toml | CREATE new file with server config | P4 |
| src/logic/bundle_utils.py | CREATE new file for path resolution | P2 |
| src/ui/main_app.py | Working directory handling | P2 |
| src/logic/server_manager.py | Timeout increase, health check | P3, P6 |
| build/scripts/build_windows.sh | Add .streamlit data, hidden imports | P4, P5 |
| build/scripts/build_unix.sh | Add .streamlit data, hidden imports | P4, P5 |

### Exit Code 2 Analysis

Exit code 2 from the Streamlit worker process indicates:
- `FileNotFoundError`: Most likely cause - can't find src/ui/main_app.py
- `ImportError`: Possible cause - missing hidden imports
- `ConfigError`: Possible cause - missing .streamlit/config.toml

The fix requires addressing all three causes.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each user story or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Test the executable after each story to catch regressions early
- Avoid: breaking previous working stories, adding features before fixing core issues
