# Specification Quality Checklist: Streamlit Application Scaffolding

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items complete

### Content Quality Assessment

- ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning Python, Streamlit internals, specific libraries, or code structure. References to "desktop window mode" and "compilable to executables" describe outcomes, not implementation.
- ✅ **User value focus**: All user stories center on template user needs: running, customizing, extending, and distributing.
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for stakeholders who understand application functionality without requiring technical expertise.
- ✅ **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- ✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification makes informed assumptions (YAML config, placeholder logo, minimal examples) documented in Assumptions section.
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 tested by checking sidebar presence, FR-015 measured with timer).
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (10 minutes, 2 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 seconds, 100%, 80%).
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic SC**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical metrics (e.g., "run within 10 minutes" not "Python startup < 2s").
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story includes Given-When-Then scenarios.
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: Five edge cases covering missing files, invalid navigation, configuration errors, UI responsiveness, and incomplete extensions.
- ✅ **Bounded scope**: Clear focus on scaffolding structure, navigation, branding, and compilation—excludes actual feature implementation.
- ✅ **Assumptions documented**: Five assumptions listed covering user knowledge, logo defaults, example content, config format, and architecture separation.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: User stories include detailed acceptance scenarios; FRs are testable.
- ✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Four prioritized stories cover download/run (P1), branding (P2), extension (P3), and compilation (P4).
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Eight success criteria provide clear validation targets.
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction barrier; implementation details reserved for planning phase.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- No clarifications needed from user—all reasonable defaults applied
- Template-first philosophy from constitution well-reflected in user stories
- Desktop compilation requirement (FR-012) aligns with constitution principle II
