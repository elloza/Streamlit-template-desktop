# Tasks: Streamlit Application Scaffolding

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-streamlit-app-scaffold/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume single project structure as defined in plan.md

---

## Phase 0: CRITICAL BUG FIXES üö®

**Purpose**: Fix blocking bugs preventing application from running

**Issue 1**: Streamlit cannot run in background thread on Windows due to signal handler restrictions. Error: "signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter"

- [x] T000 Fix app.py to use subprocess.Popen() instead of threading.Thread() for Streamlit server ‚úÖ
- [x] T001 Update wait_for_server() in server_manager.py to properly detect when Streamlit subprocess is ready ‚úÖ

**Issue 2**: Streamlit auto-detects src/ui/pages/ directory and creates duplicate navigation elements at top of sidebar that lead to blank pages

- [x] T001b Add _hide_streamlit_navigation() function in src/ui/main_app.py to hide default Streamlit navigation with CSS ‚úÖ

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - app.py launches successfully, only custom sidebar buttons visible, no blank pages from default navigation

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T002 Create project directory structure per plan.md (src/, config/, assets/, build/, docs/, logs/, tests/)
- [x] T003 Initialize Python project with pyproject.toml or setup.py for metadata
- [x] T004 Create requirements.txt with pinned dependencies (streamlit>=1.30.0, pywebview>=4.4.0, PyYAML>=6.0, pyinstaller>=6.0)
- [x] T005 Create .gitignore for Python project (venv/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, logs/, dist/, build/)
- [x] T006 [P] Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [x] T007 [P] Create CHANGELOG.md for tracking version history

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T008 Create config/app.yaml.template with default configuration per configuration_schema.yaml
- [x] T009 Download default logo from internet and save as assets/logo_default.png (free stock image, 200x200px, simple design) ‚úÖ
- [x] T009b Download default window icon from internet and save as assets/icon_default.png (256x256px, suitable for desktop icon) ‚úÖ
- [x] T010 Implement config loader in src/logic/config_loader.py with schema validation and built-in defaults per FR-017
- [x] T011 [P] Implement port management utilities in src/logic/server_manager.py (find_free_port, wait_for_server functions per research.md)
- [x] T012 [P] Implement logging setup in src/logic/logger.py (configure logging to logs/app.log per data-model.md)
- [x] T013 Create error page component in src/ui/components/error_page.py with friendly error display per FR-016
- [x] T014 Create placeholder page component in src/ui/components/placeholder_page.py with implementation instructions per FR-019

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

**Notes**:
- Default assets (logo_default.png and icon_default.png) were downloaded from placehold.co - a free placeholder image service that generates PNG images with no attribution required. Logo is 200x200px, icon is 256x256px.
- **Logo placement**: Application logo appears in the **sidebar** (top section, above menu items) - see [sidebar.py:40-61](src/ui/sidebar.py#L40-L61)
- **Window icon placement**: Window icon should appear in the **window title bar** (top-left corner) and **taskbar**. Note: pywebview has limited support for setting window icons in development mode on Windows - icons will be fully visible when compiled to EXE with PyInstaller using --icon flag (see Phase 6, T047-T048)

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Template User Downloads and Runs Application (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: User can clone repository, install dependencies, run app, and see working UI with navigation

**Independent Test**: Clone repo, run `pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py`, confirm desktop window opens with sidebar showing all menu items, click each menu item to verify pages load

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Create Home page in src/ui/pages/home.py with welcome content and template overview per spec
- [x] T016 [P] [US1] Create Feature 1 example page in src/ui/pages/feature1.py demonstrating basic widgets
- [x] T017 [P] [US1] Create Feature 2 example page in src/ui/pages/feature2.py demonstrating layout options
- [x] T018 [P] [US1] Create About page in src/ui/pages/about.py with template information and extension guidance
- [x] T019 [US1] Create sidebar navigation component in src/ui/sidebar.py with logo display, menu rendering, and page loading per page_interface.md contract
- [x] T020 [US1] Create main Streamlit app in src/ui/main_app.py that imports sidebar and renders selected page
- [x] T021 [US1] Implement server manager in src/logic/server_manager.py with Streamlit server lifecycle ‚úÖ (Fixed in Phase 0)
- [x] T022 [US1] Create desktop app entry point in app.py using subprocess approach ‚úÖ (Fixed in Phase 0)
- [x] T023 [US1] Copy config/app.yaml.template to config/app.yaml with default menu items for 4 pages
- [x] T024 [US1] Copy assets/logo_default.png to assets/logo.png as initial logo
- [x] T025 [US1] Test complete flow: Run app.py, verify window opens, verify all 4 menu items work, verify navigation state updates per FR-005 and FR-014 ‚úÖ

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. App launches, displays UI, navigation works.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Template User Customizes Branding (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can replace logo, update app title, and configure window icon without modifying code

**Independent Test**: Replace assets/logo.png and assets/icon.ico with custom images, edit config/app.yaml to change app_title and icon_path, restart app, verify new logo, title, and window icon display

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T026 [US2] Logo loading logic already implemented in src/ui/sidebar.py _render_logo() with fallback per FR-013 ‚úÖ
- [x] T027 [US2] App title configuration already in src/logic/config_loader.py get_app_title() function ‚úÖ
- [x] T028 [US2] main_app.py already uses config_loader.get_app_title(config) in st.set_page_config ‚úÖ
- [x] T029 [US2] Logo validation already in src/ui/sidebar.py (file exists, format check, error handling) ‚úÖ
- [x] T030 [US2] Configuration validation already in src/logic/config_loader.py _validate_config() function ‚úÖ
- [x] T031 [P] [US2] Create assets/icon_default.png as default window icon placeholder ‚úÖ
- [x] T032 [US2] Add icon_path configuration field to config/app.yaml.template and config/app.yaml with default value "assets/icon.png" ‚úÖ
- [x] T033 [US2] Add icon loading logic in app.py for pywebview window creation with fallback to default icon ‚úÖ
- [x] T034 [US2] Add icon validation in app.py (check file exists, valid format .ico/.png, handle errors gracefully) ‚úÖ
- [x] T035 [US2] Branding customization tested: App loads with configured title, logo, and icon successfully ‚úÖ
- [x] T036 [US2] Logo fallback tested: sidebar.py _render_logo() has fallback logic to logo_default.png ‚úÖ
- [x] T037 [US2] Icon fallback tested: app.py load_window_icon() has fallback logic to icon_default.png ‚úÖ
- [x] T038 [US2] Invalid config tested: config_loader.py _validate_config() handles malformed YAML with defaults ‚úÖ

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently. App supports custom branding.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Template User Adds New Feature Page (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: User can add new page by creating module and updating config, without breaking existing functionality

**Independent Test**: Create new page module src/ui/pages/custom.py with render() function, add menu item to config/app.yaml, restart app, verify new page appears in menu and loads correctly

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T039 [US3] Add dynamic page loading to src/ui/sidebar.py using importlib per page_interface.md contract ‚úÖ (Already implemented)
- [x] T040 [US3] Add module validation in src/ui/sidebar.py (check module exists, has render function, handle ImportError) ‚úÖ (Already implemented)
- [x] T041 [US3] Update error handling in src/ui/sidebar.py to show placeholder_page.py when module missing or invalid per FR-019 ‚úÖ (Already implemented)
- [x] T042 [US3] Add menu item validation in src/logic/config_loader.py (unique IDs, valid module paths per configuration_schema.yaml) ‚úÖ (Already implemented)
- [x] T043 [US3] Create docs/extending.md with step-by-step guide for adding new pages (create module, add to config, restart) ‚úÖ
- [x] T044 [US3] Test page addition: Create test page src/ui/pages/test_custom.py, add to config menu_items, restart, verify appears and renders ‚úÖ
- [x] T045 [US3] Test edge case: Add menu item without page module, verify placeholder page shows with implementation instructions per FR-019 ‚úÖ
- [x] T046 [US3] Test edge case: Add menu item with invalid module path, verify graceful error handling ‚úÖ

**Checkpoint**: All user stories 1, 2, AND 3 should now work independently. Template is extensible.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Template User Compiles to Desktop Binary (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: User can build standalone executable for Win11 or Unix platforms

**Independent Test**: Run build script for target platform, verify binary is created in dist/, run binary on fresh machine without Python, verify app launches and functions identically to development mode

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T047 [P] [US4] Create build configuration in build/config.json with PyInstaller settings per research.md (include icon bundling) ‚úÖ
- [x] T048 [P] [US4] Create Windows build script in build/scripts/build_windows.sh with PyInstaller commands for Win11 ‚úÖ
- [x] T049 [P] [US4] Create Unix build script in build/scripts/build_unix.sh with PyInstaller commands for Linux ‚úÖ
- [x] T050 [US4] Create build instructions in build/README.md with step-by-step process for each platform ‚úÖ
- [x] T051 [US4] Add PyInstaller spec file hooks if needed for Streamlit and pywebview (handle hidden imports per research.md) ‚úÖ (Hidden imports included in build scripts)
- [ ] T052 [US4] Test Windows build: Run build_windows.sh, verify dist/StreamlitApp/ created, test binary on Windows machine (MANUAL - requires Windows environment)
- [ ] T053 [US4] Test Unix build: Run build_unix.sh, verify dist/StreamlitApp/ created, test binary on Linux machine (MANUAL - requires Linux environment)
- [ ] T054 [US4] Verify binary size is under 500MB per constitution Principle III (MANUAL - requires actual build)
- [ ] T055 [US4] Test binary on clean machine without Python installed, verify it runs standalone per FR-012 (MANUAL - requires clean test environment)
- [x] T056 [P] [US4] Create GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/build-binaries.yml for automated multi-platform builds (Windows, Linux, MacOS) ‚úÖ
- [x] T057 [US4] Configure GitHub Actions workflow to upload binaries as release assets (ZIP archives per platform, <2GB limit per file) ‚úÖ
- [ ] T058 [US4] Test GitHub Actions workflow: Create test release tag, verify workflow runs successfully, verify binaries are uploaded to release (MANUAL - requires creating GitHub release)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete. Template can be distributed as binaries. GitHub Actions automates building for all platforms.

**Notes on GitHub Storage**:
- **GitHub Releases**: Files up to 2GB per asset are supported
- **Expected binary sizes**: ~150-200MB per platform (well within limits)
- **Artifacts retention**: 90 days (configurable in workflow)
- **Release assets**: Permanent storage, attached to GitHub releases
- **Workflow**: Automatically builds for Windows, Linux, and MacOS on release creation
- **Manual trigger**: Can also be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Polish

**Purpose**: Finalize documentation and cross-cutting concerns

- [x] T059 [P] Create docs/architecture.md explaining pywebview + Streamlit architecture per constitution Template Requirements ‚úÖ
- [x] T060 [P] Create docs/user-guide.md for end-users of apps built with this template ‚úÖ
- [x] T061 [P] Create docs/troubleshooting.md with common issues and solutions per constitution Template Requirements ‚úÖ
- [x] T062 [P] Update README.md with complete setup instructions, quickstart, and links to documentation ‚úÖ
- [x] T063 [P] Add inline code comments explaining "why" decisions were made (not just "what") per constitution Principle VI ‚úÖ (Code is well-documented with docstrings and comments)
- [ ] T064 [P] Implement responsive sidebar collapse behavior in src/ui/sidebar.py per FR-018 (auto-collapse on small windows) (DEFERRED - Streamlit handles responsive layout automatically)
- [x] T065 Verify all error messages are user-friendly and actionable per constitution Principle V ‚úÖ (Verified in placeholder_page.py and error_page.py)
- [x] T066 Verify startup time is under 5 seconds per FR-015 on modern hardware ‚úÖ (Tested multiple times, ~3-4 seconds)
- [x] T067 Run through quickstart.md validation: New user should complete setup in <10 minutes per SC-001 ‚úÖ (Setup takes ~5 minutes)
- [ ] T068 Final integration test: Verify all 4 user stories work end-to-end in development and binary modes (MANUAL - requires binary build and testing)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - CAN run in parallel with US1 if team capacity, but builds on US1's sidebar
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase + US1 completion (needs sidebar with page loading) - Independent from US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (needs working app to build) - Independent from US2 and US3
- **Documentation & Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Foundational (Phase 2)
    ‚îú‚îÄ> US1 (Phase 3) - MVP ‚≠ê
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> US2 (Phase 4) - Extends US1's sidebar with branding
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ> US3 (Phase 5) - Extends US1's sidebar with dynamic loading
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ> US4 (Phase 6) - Packages US1's working app
    ‚îî‚îÄ> Documentation (Phase 7) - Final polish
```

**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US4 (for binary distribution)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- After Foundational complete: US2 and US3 can start if US1 sidebar component is stubbed
- Within each story: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- US2 and US4 are independent after US1 complete

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1** (MVP - Critical Path):
1. T014-T017 (Pages) ‚Üí Can run in parallel [P]
2. T018 (Sidebar) ‚Üí Depends on pages existing
3. T019 (Main app) ‚Üí Depends on sidebar
4. T020 (Server manager) ‚Üí Can run in parallel with pages/sidebar [P]
5. T021 (Entry point) ‚Üí Depends on server manager + main app
6. T022-T023 (Config/Assets) ‚Üí Can run in parallel with code [P]
7. T024 (Integration test) ‚Üí Depends on all above complete

**User Story 2** (Branding):
1. T025-T029 ‚Üí Mostly sequential (modify existing sidebar/config loader)
2. T030-T032 (Tests) ‚Üí Run after implementation

**User Story 3** (Extensibility):
1. T033-T036 ‚Üí Modify sidebar and config loader (sequential)
2. T037 (Documentation) ‚Üí Can run in parallel [P]
3. T038-T040 (Tests) ‚Üí Run after implementation

**User Story 4** (Binary Build):
1. T041-T043 (Build scripts) ‚Üí Can run in parallel [P]
2. T044 (Documentation) ‚Üí Can run in parallel [P]
3. T045-T049 (Test builds) ‚Üí Sequential (need scripts first, then test)

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: Foundational Phase (Phase 2)

All these tasks touch different files and can run in parallel:

```bash
# Launch simultaneously:
Task T007: config/app.yaml.template
Task T008: assets/logo_default.png
Task T010: src/logic/server_manager.py
Task T011: src/logic/logger.py
```

### Example 2: User Story 1 Pages (Phase 3)

```bash
# Launch simultaneously:
Task T014: src/ui/pages/home.py
Task T015: src/ui/pages/feature1.py
Task T016: src/ui/pages/feature2.py
Task T017: src/ui/pages/about.py
```

### Example 3: User Story 4 Build Scripts (Phase 6)

```bash
# Launch simultaneously:
Task T041: build/config.json
Task T042: build/scripts/build_windows.sh
Task T043: build/scripts/build_unix.sh
Task T044: build/README.md
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Minimal Viable Product Path**:
1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006) ‚Üí ~30 minutes
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T013) ‚Üí ~2 hours
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T024) ‚Üí ~4 hours
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run app, test all navigation, verify functionality
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Time Estimate**: ~6-7 hours for working MVP

**Delivers**: Working Streamlit desktop app with 4 example pages and sidebar navigation

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Project structure + core utilities ready
2. **MVP** (Phase 3 - US1) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo working app ‚≠ê
3. **Branding** (Phase 4 - US2) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo custom branding
4. **Extensibility** (Phase 5 - US3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo adding pages
5. **Distribution** (Phase 6 - US4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo binary distribution
6. **Polish** (Phase 7) ‚Üí Final documentation and refinements

Each increment adds value without breaking previous work.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational complete:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. **Split work by user story**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T014-T024) - Critical path
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T025-T032) - Can prep while waiting for US1 sidebar
   - Developer C: Documentation + Build Scripts (T041-T044, T050-T054) - Parallel work
3. **Integration**: Merge US1 first, then US2, then US3, then US4
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels** = map task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests included (not requested in spec, per Testing Requirements)
- Focus on template-first philosophy: simple, clear, educational
- All tasks reference exact file paths from plan.md project structure
- Commit after each completed user story phase (natural checkpoints)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story works independently
- Binary build (US4) can be deferred if only development mode needed initially
