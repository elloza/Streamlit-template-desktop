# Feature Specification: Streamlit Application Scaffolding

**Feature Branch**: `001-streamlit-app-scaffold`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Quiero que hagas el scafolding de la aplicación de Streamlit con un un menu lateral con diferentes opciones (Home, feature 1, feauture 2 etc) y un about the project final. Debe tener un espacio para un logo por defecto de la aplicación. La idea es tener un esqueleto para empezar una aplicación."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17

- Q: When the logo file is missing or invalid, what should the application display? → A: Display a default placeholder image included with the template
- Q: When a user navigates to a non-existent page (e.g., broken menu configuration), what should happen? → A: Display friendly error page with navigation back to home
- Q: How should the application behave when the configuration file (YAML) is missing or has syntax errors? → A: Use built-in defaults and log warning
- Q: How should the application handle responsive layout when the window becomes very small? → A: Sidebar auto-collapses on small windows, remains functional
- Q: When a template user adds a menu item but forgets to implement the corresponding page, what should happen? → A: Show helpful placeholder page with implementation instructions

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Template User Downloads and Runs Application (Priority: P1)

A developer downloads this template project, installs dependencies, and runs the example application to verify their environment is correctly configured before beginning customization.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational use case. If users cannot successfully run the example application, the template fails its primary purpose. This must work flawlessly to establish trust and provide a working baseline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository, following setup instructions, running the application, and confirming the UI displays with all navigation elements functioning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh project clone, **When** user follows setup and run instructions, **Then** application launches and displays the home page with sidebar navigation
2. **Given** application is running, **When** user clicks on any sidebar menu item, **Then** corresponding page loads without errors
3. **Given** application is running, **When** user views the sidebar, **Then** application logo is visible at the top
4. **Given** application is running, **When** user navigates to "About the Project", **Then** project information page displays

### User Story 2 - Template User Customizes Branding (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to personalize the template by replacing the default logo with their own branding and updating the application title.

**Why this priority**: After verifying the template works, the first customization users want is to make it their own. Logo and title changes are non-invasive and build confidence in extending the template.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by replacing the default logo file, updating configuration for app title, restarting the application, and verifying the new branding appears.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has their own logo image file, **When** they replace the default logo file, **Then** their logo displays in the sidebar upon restart
2. **Given** user wants to change the app title, **When** they update the configuration, **Then** the new title appears in the browser tab and application header
3. **Given** custom branding is applied, **When** application runs, **Then** all pages consistently display the custom branding

---

### User Story 3 - Template User Adds New Feature Page (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to add a new feature page to the application by creating a new menu item and corresponding page content.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the extensibility of the template. Users need to understand how to add functionality without breaking the existing structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following extension documentation to add a new menu item and page, then verifying it appears in navigation and renders correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user follows extension guide, **When** they add a new page module, **Then** new menu item appears in sidebar navigation
2. **Given** new feature page is added, **When** user clicks the new menu item, **Then** the page content displays correctly
3. **Given** multiple custom pages exist, **When** user navigates between them, **Then** navigation state updates correctly and no errors occur

---

### User Story 4 - Template User Compiles to Desktop Binary (Priority: P4)

A developer wants to package their customized application as a standalone desktop executable for distribution to end users.

**Why this priority**: This is the ultimate goal but comes after development and customization. Users must first have working application code before compilation makes sense.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following build instructions for the target platform, executing the build process, and running the generated binary to confirm it launches and functions identically to the development version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application works in development mode, **When** user follows build instructions for their platform, **Then** build process completes without errors
2. **Given** binary is generated, **When** user runs the executable, **Then** application launches with full functionality
3. **Given** binary is distributed to another machine, **When** end user runs it, **Then** application runs without requiring Python installation

### Edge Cases

- **Logo file missing or invalid format**: Application displays default placeholder image included with template
- **Navigation to non-existent page**: Application displays friendly error page with clear message and navigation link back to home page
- **Configuration file malformed or missing**: Application uses built-in default values and logs warning message, allowing application to continue functioning
- **Window resized to small dimensions**: Sidebar automatically collapses to save space while remaining accessible via toggle, maintaining full functionality
- **Menu item without corresponding page content**: Application displays helpful placeholder page with step-by-step instructions on how to implement the page, serving as educational guide for template users

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Application MUST display a sidebar navigation menu on all pages
- **FR-002**: Sidebar MUST include a logo display area at the top
- **FR-003**: Navigation menu MUST include at minimum: Home, Feature 1 example, Feature 2 example, and About the Project
- **FR-004**: Application MUST load corresponding page content when user clicks a menu item
- **FR-005**: Navigation MUST visually indicate the currently active page
- **FR-006**: Logo MUST be replaceable by users through simple file substitution
- **FR-007**: Application title MUST be configurable without modifying core code
- **FR-008**: Application MUST provide a clear directory structure for users to add new pages
- **FR-009**: Example pages (Home, Feature 1, Feature 2) MUST contain placeholder content demonstrating typical page structure
- **FR-010**: About the Project page MUST display template information and guidance for users
- **FR-011**: Application MUST run in desktop window mode (not browser-based as traditional Streamlit)
- **FR-012**: Application MUST be compilable to standalone executables for Win11 and Unix platforms
- **FR-013**: Application MUST handle missing or invalid logo files gracefully by displaying a default placeholder image included with the template
- **FR-014**: Navigation MUST maintain state across page transitions
- **FR-015**: Application MUST load within 5 seconds on modern hardware
- **FR-016**: Application MUST display a friendly error page with navigation to home when attempting to access non-existent pages
- **FR-017**: Application MUST use built-in default configuration values when config file is missing or malformed, and log warnings to help users identify issues
- **FR-018**: Sidebar MUST automatically collapse when window width becomes too small, with toggle button to expand/collapse manually
- **FR-019**: Application MUST display a helpful placeholder page with implementation instructions when a menu item is added without corresponding page content

### Assumptions

- Users have basic Python knowledge and can follow installation instructions
- Default logo will be a generic placeholder (e.g., simple geometric shape or text-based logo)
- Example feature pages will contain minimal demonstration content (headers, text, basic widgets)
- Configuration will use YAML format for user-friendly editing
- Desktop wrapping solution architecture is defined separately (not part of this spec)

### Key Entities

- **Navigation Menu**: Collection of menu items, each linking to a specific page, displayed in sidebar
- **Page**: Individual content view with unique identifier, content components, and optional page-specific configuration
- **Application Configuration**: Settings defining app title, branding, menu structure, and runtime behavior
- **Logo Asset**: Image file displayed in sidebar header for application branding
